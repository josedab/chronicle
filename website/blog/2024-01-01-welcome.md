title: Introducing Chronicle — An Embedded Time-Series Database for Go

We're excited to announce the open source release of **Chronicle**, an embedded time-series database designed specifically for Go applications.

## Why We Built Chronicle

Time-series data is everywhere — from IoT sensors and application metrics to financial data and user analytics. But existing solutions often require running a separate database server, which adds operational complexity and resource overhead.

We asked: *What if you could have the power of a time-series database without the infrastructure?*

Chronicle is our answer. It's a single-file, embedded database that runs directly in your Go application with zero external dependencies.

## What Makes Chronicle Different

### Embedded Architecture

Unlike InfluxDB, Prometheus, or TimescaleDB, Chronicle doesn't require a separate server process. Your application *is* the database:

```go
db, _ := chronicle.Open("metrics.db", chronicle.DefaultConfig("metrics.db"))
defer db.Close()

// That's it. No connection strings, no network calls.
```

### Prometheus Compatibility

We didn't want you to learn a new query language. Chronicle supports PromQL, so you can use the same queries you already know:

```go
executor := chronicle.NewPromQLExecutor(db)
result, _ := executor.Query(`rate(http_requests_total[5m])`, time.Now())
```

### Built for the Edge

Chronicle runs on Raspberry Pi, compiles to WebAssembly, and works in memory-constrained environments. It's designed from the ground up for edge computing and IoT workloads.

### Zero Dependencies

The entire database is pure Go with no CGO or external libraries. This means:
- Single binary deployments
- Cross-compilation just works
- No runtime dependencies to manage

## Core Features

- **10-15x compression** with Gorilla encoding
- **SQL and PromQL** query support
- **Built-in alerting** with webhook notifications
- **Time-series forecasting** with Holt-Winters
- **HTTP API** compatible with InfluxDB line protocol
- **WebSocket streaming** for real-time updates
- **Encryption at rest** with AES-256-GCM

## Get Started

```bash
go get github.com/chronicle-db/chronicle
```

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
    "github.com/chronicle-db/chronicle"
)

func main() {
    db, _ := chronicle.Open("demo.db", chronicle.DefaultConfig("demo.db"))
    defer db.Close()

    db.Write(chronicle.Point{
        Metric:    "temperature",
        Tags:      map[string]string{"sensor": "outdoor"},
        Value:     22.5,
        Timestamp: time.Now().UnixNano(),
    })

    result, _ := db.Execute(&chronicle.Query{Metric: "temperature"})
    fmt.Printf("Temperature: %.1f°C\n", result.Points[0].Value)
}
```

## What's Next

We're actively developing Chronicle and have an exciting roadmap:

- **Clustering** for high availability
- **More storage backends** (Azure Blob, GCS)
- **Enhanced ML integration** for anomaly detection
- **Improved query performance** with columnar optimizations
